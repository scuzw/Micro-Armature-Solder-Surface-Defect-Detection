# Micro-Armature-Solder-Surface-Defect-Detection
This repository is the open source dataset for micro armature solder surface defect detection(MASS-DET). MASS-DET dataset is collected in the a commercial company, containing six common types of defects with localization annotations.

Our paper is edtitled “Micro Armature Solder Surface Detection: An Adaptive Central Region Sample Selection Anchor Free Framework”. Now that the dataset is available, you can browse it by downloading the "/dataset/MASS-DET.zip" file from the repository.

The MASS-Det dataset is strictly forbidden to be used for commercial purposes and should only be used for academic research.
